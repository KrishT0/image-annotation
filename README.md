# Image Annotation Tool

This is a simple tool to annotate images for object detection. It is written in Javascript using ReactJs. This is a frontend-only tool, so it does not require any backend or server to run.

## Usage

To use the tool, simply run the script and select the folder containing the images you want to annotate. The images will be displayed , and you can draw bounding boxes around the objects you want to detect. The annotations will be downloaded in a .json file.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
